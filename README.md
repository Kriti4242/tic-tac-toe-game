# TIC_TAC_TOE
This project is a fully functional, responsive Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. 
The user interface features a modern "Glassmorphism" aesthetic, achieved through semi-transparent backgrounds and a gradient backdrop. 
The layout utilizes CSS Grid to maintain a perfect square aspect ratio as well.
